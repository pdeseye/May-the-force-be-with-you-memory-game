Set up a board with cards themed with Star Wars (having the back have the same image.)
Create an array of SW themed items/character pairs
Shuffle the cards in the array
Create a front and back side to the card. Front side has the letter.
Use an event listener to toggle between front and backside of the card
Allow the player to click on two cards at a time
Compare the images of the two cards that are clicked
If the images on the card match, the cards should stay facing forward, if not the cards should turn back around.
Clear the array that is storing the two cards that are compared so that two new cards can be selected
The player will continue playing until all cards are matched
Create a replay button
Create the light/dark button.
Try and add some Star Wars music or something of that nature play when the player matched cards.
